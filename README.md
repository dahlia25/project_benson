# Readme

## Smaller heading

### Even smaller heading

#### Tiny heading

##### Just bold

## A more top level heading

This is **not** a good example of a README.

It basically tells me nothing.

Don't write like this.

Here is my checklist of things to do:
* Get the MTA data
* Clean missing values
* Lookup census data
* Make predictions on which stations to use for signatures
* ...
* PROFIT!

## Responsibilities

| Person | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
|Chad | Find the data |
|Chad | Clean the data |
| Damien | Collect the money |

## Acknowledgements

*Some* help from Chad.

But seriously, most of the work is mine.

## Priorities

1. Make presentation
2. Collect the check
3. Flight to Cayman Islands
